**Summary of Efron's 1981 Biometrika Paper on Nonparametric Estimates of Standard Error**

In his paper, Efron (1981) investigates the problem of estimating the standard error of a statistical estimate when the underlying assumptions of traditional parametric methods are not met. He proposes a nonparametric approach that can be used to estimate the standard error in such cases.

The key idea behind Efron's method is to use the bootstrap resampling technique. This involves repeatedly sampling from the observed data with replacement to create multiple bootstrap samples. The estimate of interest is then computed using each bootstrap sample. The variability of these estimates across the bootstrap samples can be used to obtain an estimate of the standard error.

Efron discusses the theoretical foundations of the bootstrap method and provides practical guidelines for its implementation. He also presents simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the bootstrap method in estimating standard errors in nonparametric settings.

Overall, Efron's paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of nonparametric statistical inference by offering a practical and effective approach for estimating standard errors in situations where traditional parametric methods are not applicable.
